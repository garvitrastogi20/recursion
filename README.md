## üìò What I‚Äôve Learned So Far

### ‚úÖ What is Recursion?

Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. It's commonly used in problems involving repetition, branching, or divide-and-conquer strategies.

**Example (Factorial):**
```cpp
int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0) return 1;  // base condition
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
```
## ‚úÖ Core Concepts of Recursion

### üîπ Base Condition
Every recursive function must have a **base condition** ‚Äî the stopping criteria. It ensures that the recursion eventually ends.

> Without a base case, the function will run infinitely and cause a crash (stack overflow).

### üîπ Stack Overflow / Stack Space
Each recursive call uses a new frame on the call stack. If too many recursive calls are made, it can exhaust the memory and result in a **stack overflow error**.

### üîπ Recursion Tree
A recursion tree is a diagram showing how a recursive function expands at each level. It helps in understanding the recursive flow and analyzing **time complexity**.

**Example:** Recursion tree for `fib(4)`:
```
            fib(4)
           /     \
      fib(3)     fib(2)
     /     \     /     \
 fib(2)  fib(1) fib(1) fib(0)
 /    \
fib(1) fib(0)
```

## üßæ Basic Recursion Programs

These are the first few programs I wrote to understand recursion and how **backtracking** affects the execution.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Print 1 to N (Increasing Order)
```cpp
void print1ToN(int i, int n) {
    if (i > n) return;
    std::cout << i << " ";
    print1ToN(i + 1, n);
}
```
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Print N to 1 (Decreasing Order)

üìå Goal: Print numbers from `N` to `1` using direct recursion.

```cpp
void printNTo1(int n) {
    if (n == 0) return;
    std::cout << n << " ";
    printNTo1(n - 1);
}
```
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Print 1 to N using Backtracking
üìå Goal: Print numbers from 1 to N using backtracking.
```cpp
void print1ToN_Backtrack(int n) {
    if (n == 0) return;
    print1ToN_Backtrack(n - 1);
    std::cout << n << " ";
}
```
üîÑ Backtracking allows you to print values after the recursive call, so the values come in reverse order of the call stack.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Print N to 1 using Backtracking
üìå Goal: Print numbers from N to 1 using recursion with backtracking.
```cpp
void printNTo1_Backtrack(int i, int n) {
    if (i > n) return;
    printNTo1_Backtrack(i + 1, n);
    std::cout << i << " ";
}
```
üîÑ Unlike the previous example, this starts from a lower value (i) and prints after all recursive calls return ‚Äî effectively printing in reverse.

## üß† Functional vs Parameterized Recursion
Two main approaches to recursion:

### ‚úÖ Parameterized Recursion
You pass results as arguments and compute them along the way. The return type is usually `void`.

```cpp
void sumParameterized(int i, int sum) {
    if (i < 1) {
        std::cout << sum << "\n";
        return;
    }
    sumParameterized(i - 1, sum + i);
}
```
###‚úÖ Functional Recursion
Each function call returns the result, which is then used in backtracking.

```cpp
int sumFunctional(int n) {
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    return n + sumFunctional(n - 1);
}
```
## üîç Key Differences Between Parameterized and Functional Recursion

| Aspect                  | Parameterized Recursion        | Functional Recursion            |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| How result is managed   | Passed as an argument          | Returned from each call         |
| Return type             | `void`                         | Typically `int` or similar      |
| Output point            | In base case                   | During backtracking             |
| Suitable for            | Printing / modifying state     | Mathematical problems           |

## ‚ûï Sum of First N Numbers
### ‚úÖ Parameterized Way

```cpp
void sumParameterized(int i, int sum) {
    if (i < 1) {
        std::cout << sum << "\n";
        return;
    }
    sumParameterized(i - 1, sum + i);
}
```
### ‚úÖ Functional Way
```cpp
int sumFunctional(int n) {
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    return n + sumFunctional(n - 1);
}
```
## ‚úñÔ∏è Factorial using Recursion
### ‚úÖ Parameterized Way

```cpp
void factorialParameterized(int i, int fact) {
    if (i == 1) {
        std::cout << fact << "\n";
        return;
    }
    factorialParameterized(i - 1, fact * i);
}
```
###‚úÖ Functional Way
```cpp
int factorialFunctional(int n) {
    if (n == 0) return 1;
    return n * factorialFunctional(n - 1);
}
```

## üê¢ Fibonacci Series using Recursion
```cpp
int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}
```
üìå Base Cases:
fib(0) = 0, fib(1) = 1

‚ö†Ô∏è Time Complexity:
O(2^N) ‚Äî exponential growth due to repeated subproblems.
---
##üå≥ Recursion Tree for fib(4)

The recursion tree helps visualize how recursive calls are made and where overlapping subproblems occur ‚Äî especially in problems like Fibonacci.
```cpp
        fib(4)
       /      \
   fib(3)    fib(2)
    /   \     /    \
fib(2) fib(1) fib(1) fib(0)
  /  \
fib(1) fib(0)
```
### üìå Observations:
The same subproblems (like `fib(2)`, `fib(1)`) are solved multiple times.
This is why the naive Fibonacci solution has exponential time complexity: `O(2^N)`.
To optimize such problems, techniques like memoization or dynamic programming are used.

---

## üîÅ Reverse an Array using Recursion

```cpp
void reverseArray(int arr[], int l, int r) {
    if (l >= r) return;
    std::swap(arr[l], arr[r]);
    reverseArray(arr, l + 1, r - 1);
}
```
Uses two-pointer recursion to reverse an array in-place.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity & Recursion Trees

| Problem                | Time Complexity | Notes                       |
|------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| Print 1 to N / N to 1  | `O(N)`          | Simple linear recursion      |
| Sum of first N numbers | `O(N)`          | Tail or head recursion       |
| Factorial              | `O(N)`          | One call per level           |
| Fibonacci (naive)      | `O(2^N)`        | Repeated calls, inefficient |
| Reverse Array          | `O(N)`          | Linear recursion using swap  |
